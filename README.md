Employer Role & Responsibilities As Per POSH Act 2013

 
According to the POSH Act 2013, the employer is responsible for safeguarding the safety of all employees. To guarantee the safety of women in the workplace, the POSH Act 2013 requires an organisation or firm's management to perform a number of things:

Make sure that all female employees have a safe place to work.

Create and distribute an organisational policy against workplace sexual harassment of women.

If your company has 10 or more employees, form an internal committee.

Display the repercussions of sexual harassment as well as the details of the Internal Committee in a prominent location in the workplace.

Organize staff education programmes on the terms of the POSH Act 2013. You may find our POSH Act Employee Awareness at MUDS Management. Members of the Internal Committee must be schooled on their duties and responsibilities. You may view our POSH Act for IC Members MUDS Management.

Provide the facilities needed and relevant data to the Internal Committee or Local Committee for the investigation of sexual harassment accusations.

Ensure that the complainant and respondent are both present during the investigation.

Assist the complainant if she decides to make a police report.

Forward a sexual harassment complaint filed by an employee to the police, either because the complainant chooses to or because the respondent is a third party.

Treat sexual harassment as a violation of the service rules and take appropriate action.

Make certain that the IC sends the Annual Report to management and the District Officer. This only applies to businesses with 10 or more employees.

Declare the organization's POSH Act Compliance in the Director's Report if it is registered as a business.
